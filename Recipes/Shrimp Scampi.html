        <li>4 oz dry capellini / angelhair pasta</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Extra Virgin Olive oil</li>

        <li>2 each lemons</li>
        <li>¼ cup white wine</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp capers</li>
        <li>½ Cup cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>½ Cup seafood stock</li>
        <li>2 oz butter, cubed</li>
        <li>1 parmesan cheese wedge</li>
        <li>1 sprig  basil, picked</li>
        <li>TT Salt and Fresh Cracked Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add water to a 4 quart sauce pot. Salt liberally, cover with a lid and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Heat a medium nonstick saute pan on medium heat with one tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
        <li>When hot, add the diced shallots and finely grate the garlic bulbs into the pan and saute for 2 minutes to soften them.</li>
        <li>Deglaze the pan with the white wine and cook until it is almost evaporated from the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the seafood stock, chili flakes, capers, cherry tomatoes and lemons (zested and juiced).</li>
        <li>When the sauce comes to a simmer, season the raw shrimp with salt and pepper and poach in the liquid for about 1 minute per side.</li>
        <li>Add the cubed butter to melt.</li>
        <li>Taste and season the sauce accordingly.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, when the pot of water begins to boil, add the pasta and use tongs or a fork to gradually push it into the seasoned water as it starts to soften. Boil the pasta, stirring occasionally so it doesn’t stick together, for about 3-5 minutes, or until al dente.</li>
        <li>Strain the pasta and quickly add it to the pan with the scampi sauce and cooked shrimp. Toss the pasta in the sauce to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Finally, tear the fresh basil leaves and toss into the pasta before plating.</li>
        <li>Plate the cooked pasta into a medium size bowl with some height. Garnish with a grating of Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
    </ol>
